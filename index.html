                Hello! My name is Peter, and I am passionate about learning.
                <!-- I've come to realize that all things in life are a marathon, not a sprint (except sprints, like the running sprints, those are still sprints) -->
                I believe there is a lot of truth in the quote 'all things in life are a marathon, not a sprint',
                especially when it comes to learning.

                I've recently graduated from the University of Calgary with a combined degree
                in Finance and Computer Science. I am interested in a wide variety of topics, as of right now, I am
                learning more about Low Level Programming, Steganography, Computer Security, Commodity Markets, and
                Neural Networks.

                Currently I am also working through 'Crafting Interpreters', which has so far been enjoyable and
                informative
                with gaining a deeper understanding of what goes on under the hood when executing code written in
                languages such as Python.

                        Designed and developed with minimal supervision an extensive research database using Julia and
                        PostgreSQL
                        to store Ethereum blockchain data queried from a GETH / RETH node, with over 5+ billion rows
                        stored across multiple tables. Completed while as a research assistant for Dr. Alfred Lehar at
                        the
                        University of Calgary. To view other work I did as a research assistant, please feel free to

                        The database uses concurrent processes, and has mechanisms employed to consistently check data
                        integrity, correct any data
                        inconsistencies found, automatically create new partitions for tables, comprehensively log
                        events, and send email
                        notifications if something went wrong.

                        Working in a team with 2 partners, we created a full stack application called Find My Ride.
                        The app is a tool that can aid in checking if a stolen vehicle is being resold on popular
                        buy-&-sell websites such as Kijiji, by using a detailed description of the vehicle by the user
                        to
                        help find it from listings that have been scraped from these websites. The app has a dedicated
                        scraper which actively scrapes new listings as they appear on the sites. This was our final
                        project submission for CPSC 471 [Data Base Management Systems]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My contribution to the app was setting up and implementing the functionality of the database,
                        which was implemented using
                        Python3 and PostgreSQL, tested on Ubuntu 18.04. I wrote the code to define and to create the
                        data base tables, to handle internal data base functions, to handle insertions into the
                        database from a user and the scraper,
                        to handle matching user information against scraped information present in the database, and to
                        handle removing user searches.

                    <p>
                        Working with a partner, we designed and developed a naïve arbitrage trading bot that would
                        search for and attempt to execute profitable opportunities between multiple decentralized
                        exchanges (DEXes) on the Ethereum network as part of the FNCE 559 (Decentralized Finance) final
                        group project
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We designed the system architecture to be implemented 'off-chain', the strategy for finding
                        profitable trades, and the smart contract architecture which would be implemented 'on-chain'.
                        The project was implemented
                        in julia and solidity, where soldity is a high-level language for developing smart contracts on
                        the
                        Ethereum blockchain.

                    <p>
                        minserver is a minimal http server I built using the http library in node.js to host static
                        websites to easily test websites or for general hosting. It can handle requests from the browser
                        for
                        CSS and JavaScript files, along with other MIME types (however it doesn't handle everything). I
                        needed to create a simple http webserver server in-order to actually test out this website,
                        which was hosting using an IPv6 address.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The server should primarily be used for testing or hosting simple static sites. For other needs
                        there exists better options.

                    <p>
                        Within a team of 4, I help developed an AI Scheduler System which uses
                        genetic set-based search and an or-tree search to build a schedule. Completed as part of a the
                        final project for CPSC 443: Artificial
                        Intelligence. The two algorithms implemented into the solution (set-based search and the
                        or-tree), where two of a few algorithms introduced to us in the class. The final project was in
                        two parts, the first was a technical document outlining how the system would be implemented, and
                        the second was implementing what we had outlined in the Java.

                    <p>
                        Working with a partner, we developed a video game that runs on a Raspberry Pi, which is playable
                        using a SNES controller as part
                        of an assignment for the course CPSC 359 (Computing Machinery II). The SNES is connected to the
                        GPIO of
                        the Raspberry Pi through use of a bread-board. The entire video game, along with handling the
                        SNES
                        controller, is all done using the C programming language. The video game is a top-down view,
                        arcade style, puzzle-solving and skillful game.

                    <strong>Course Description:</strong>
                    The course covered the fundamentals of and the current best practices in cryptography, with an
                    emphasis on attaining well-defined and practical notations of security. Covering cryptographic
                    primatives, encryption algorithms, foundational mathematical theorems, symmetric key cryptography,
                    public key cryptography,
                    key exchanges and
                    management, mechanisms for data integrity, and more.

                <p>
                    <strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong> The course provided a strong foundation of the above mentioned
                    topics, along with use in modern applications. The course included assignments which gave us the
                    opportunity to implement cryptography using Python which was incredibly useful in understanding the
                    mechanisms at work. Assignments included creating an encryption algorithm, implementing a version of
                    the Kerberos protocol, and implementing a QR ticket application.

                    lambda calculus, beta-reduction, confluence, reduction strategies, recursion patterns, parsing,
                    unification and useful combinators to name some of the topics.

                    probably the
                    hardest and most enjoyable assignment I have ever done. The assignment was to exploit
                    vulnerabilities in multiple C programs on a server, using information we had learned in class. It
